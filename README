# TFLite-MC (Tensorflow Lite - Microchip)

Primary goal of this project is to port Tensorflow-Lite to Microchip device. Reason behind this port was so that I can deploy an inference engine on Microchip's PIC18F45k20. 
Considering that use case will significantly defer per use case, this fork aims to provide a portable method to tweak core usability without loosing any significant features. 

Requirements
==============
- python
- tensorflow
- make
- cmake
- xxd

Supported Tensorflow operations
